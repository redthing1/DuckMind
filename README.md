# DuckMind

a research project: generalizing Sorâ€™s AI engine, providing a multi-layered game-playing agent

## overview

DuckMind is a collection of projects that are based on Sor's AI engine, and provides its game-playing AI functionality as a reusable library.

It implements the multi-phase AI system described in my [Duck Intelligence](https://blog.rie.icu/post/duck_intelligence_presentation/) presentation<sup>[PDF](https://github.com/xdrie/Sor/releases/download/0.6.6.05-dev/Sor.Duck.Intelligence.pdf)</sup>.

Generally, this system is based around the idea of hierarchically combining multiple advanced game-playing AI algorithms into a decision making and action pipeline.
