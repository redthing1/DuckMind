## HEXACO Review of Research and Theory

> The HEXACO model of personality structure consists of six dimensions—Honesty-Humility (H), Emotionality (E), Extraversion (X), Agreeableness (A), Conscientiousness (C), and Openness to Experience (O)

> The six-factor structure overlaps heavily with the classic Big Five of early English lexical studies. The X, C, and O factors are largely the same as their Big Five counterparts, apart from the deliberate exclusion of intellectual ability from HEXACO O. However, the H, A, and E dimensions do not correspond isomorphically to any of the classic Big Five factors; instead, these three dimensions incorporate the variance associated with Big Five Agreeableness and Neuroticism (versus Emotional Stability) factors as well as additional variance not captured within the classic Big Five. To use Goldberg’s (2001) term, the variance of the Big Five is “reorganized” in the six-factor structure.

> Adjectives that typically define the lexical E factorrecall that in the HEXACO framework, E represents Emotionality, not eXtraversion—include vulnerable, sensitive, anxious, and sentimental versus fearless, tough, independent, and unemotional. This factor shares some content with Big Five Neuroticism (e.g., anxiety), but lacks the anger-related aspects of Neuroticism and instead contains sentimentality-related traits that are associated with Big Five Agreeableness. Adjectives that typically define the lexical A factor include peaceful, gentle, patient, and agreeable versus quick-tempered, choleric, stubborn, and quarrelsome. The lexical A factor shares some content with the classic Big Five Agreeableness factor (e.g., gentleness), but lacks the sentimentality-related aspects of that factor and instead contains (at its low pole) the anger-related traits that are associated with Big Five Neuroticism. Adjectives that typically define the lexical H factor include honest, sincere, fair, and modest versus greedy, conceited, deceitful, and pretentious. In the classic Big Five framework, these terms are typically peripheral elements of Big Five Agreeableness.
